# MyUdacityProjects
Projects completed while studying my Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree through Western Govornors University (WGU)

## Udacity Nanodegree Through WGU
Udacity is a for-profit online education organization that offeres nanodegrees in various IT fields of current interest. WGU has partnered with Udacity to provide Data Analytics training for WGU's Data Management/Data Analytics Bachalor of Science program. There project represent all the educational areas covered in the nanodegree material. Each project represents competency in that area of Data Analytics.

## Projects
### Investigate a Dataset Project
The Project covers the introductory basics for loading, wrangling, and analysing data.
Data used is FBI gun data and US census data for April 2010 and July 2016.

See [investigate-a-dataset.ipynb](investigate-a-dataset.ipynb)

### Analyze A/B Test Results
The Project accesses statistical methods important to data analytics to conduct an A/B test on website data.

See [Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb](Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipyn)

### Data Modeling with Postgres
This project creates an ETL pipeline for a fictional song company Sparkfy.
The project is broken into several files that perfom seperate functions to create the ETL. More information is provided in the projects Docementation readme.

See [Data Modeling](https://github.com/falconDI/MyUdacityProjects/tree/main/Data%20Modeling)

### Wrangle and Analyse Data
Here, I pull tweet data using Twitters API and python Tweepy module to conduct data wrangling on the We Rate Dogs forum.
The Project is split into three files. The Python wrangling code to conduct the operation, a report on the wrangling operation, and a report on some visulizations pulled from the cleaned data.

See [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/falconDI/MyUdacityProjects/tree/main/DataWrangling)

### Explore Bikeshare Data - R
Using R with module ggplot2, I load and analye bikeshare data for the cities of Washington DC, Chicago, and New York

See [Explore_bikeshare_data_R_project.ipynb](Explore_bikeshare_data_R_project.ipynb)

### Machine Learning Projects
The machine learning is split into two projects; Supervised and Unsupervised Machine learning. More in the folder readme.

See [Machine Learning](https://github.com/falconDI/MyUdacityProjects/tree/main/MachineLearning)

### Build Data Dashboard
This project does use and code but Tableau to build vizulizations from 2015 United States census data. I inclued it because it is a part of the Udacity Nanodegree.

See [Unemployment Accross the US: 2015](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ethan.coolidge/viz/UnemploymentAccrosstheUS2015/Story1)
