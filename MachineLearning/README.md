# Machine Learning Prjects
I have two machine learning projects. Supervised and Unsupervised Machine learning.

## Finding Donors for CharityML Project
This project covers the basics aspects of utilizing supervised machine learning. I train a model on ficional charity data that and predict on census data to determine if a person is a good canidate to send donor info to. Most of the output is F-score information that informs me how well the model is performing.

## Creating Customer Segments with Arvato Project
Here I pracice unsupervised machine learning. The data use is real  provided by Arvato from Germany. I create a KMeans cluster model on population data and them predict customer data to see what groups on the population prefere to use the companies mail-order system.
