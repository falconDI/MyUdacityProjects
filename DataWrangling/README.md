# Wrangle and Analyze Data Project
Here I wrangle and analyze data about Titters We Rate Dogs forum using Twitter API and pythons Tweepy module. Three sources are utilized. An internal CSV file, TSV file request from a Udacity server, and tweets called from Twitterâ€™s API in JSON format to a text file.

The project is split into three files. The [wrangle_act.ipynb](wrangle_act.ipynb) file is the accual code that loads the TSV and CSV file and call the 
Twitter API, and then wrangles the data into a clean format.
The [act_report.ipynb](act_report.ipynb) file is a report on insights I generated about the data in the `wrangle_act` noebook.
[wrangle_report.ipynb](wrangle_report.ipynb) is an in-depth report on the project process and operations.
